                <p><span class="dm-dp-openingLines">I started wearing glasses</span> in 1995, and I switched to contacts in 1999. Two days ago&mdash;twenty years later&mdash;I got laser eye surgery. Here&rsquo;s the play-by-play.</p>

                <div class="dm-c-carbonWrap">
                    <script async type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?zoneid=1696&amp;serve=CVYD42T&amp;placement=danielmallcom" id="_carbonads_js"></script>

                <p>In my <a href="/articles/2018-year-in-review/">2018 Year in Review</a>, I mentioned wanting to investigate being done with glasses and contacts for good. So a month ago, I quickly Google-searched for the closest laser eye surgery place<sup class="dm-c-sidenotes--link"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> and went in for a consultation. After a brief eye exam, they told me I was eligible for the procedure.</p>

                <aside id="note1" class="dm-c-sidenotes dm-l-articleGrid--sidenote">

                    <p>This article is more about my experience than it is a review of the place I got the surgery done. If you&rsquo;re curious about how I picked, it was mostly based on a combination what was close by and reading great reviews on Google and Facebook.</p>

                </aside>

                <p>Eyes naturally change over time, so apparently about 5% of patients need an enhancement after a few years. They gave me two different prices: $3,902 for the surgery with a lifetime plan that covers enhancements for life and $2,611 that only covers enhancements for 2 years after the initial surgery. They also offered a $200 incentive on each plan if I did the procedure before the end of the month.</p>

                <p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to do the procedure and recover for some upcoming travel, so I put it off a few weeks, which gave me some additional time to think about it. <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">Knowing a little bit about how people set prices</a>, the $200 incentive clued me in to the possibility that they might need the business more than I wanted to have unassisted perfect vision. A week ago, I called back to schedule the procedure, and I told them that I&rsquo;d love to do the lifetime plan but that I didn&rsquo;t really want to spend more than $3,000 on this. After a brief hold, they said that, in addition to the original $200 discount they offered, they could do an additional $500 off for local customers, bringing the total to $3,202. I accepted their clearly-fabricated but still-gracious additional discount and picked a date.</p>

                <p>They called in a few eye drop prescriptions to my pharmacy and told me to not wear contacts</p>
