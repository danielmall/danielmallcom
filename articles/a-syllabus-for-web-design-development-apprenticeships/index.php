            <div class="dm-dp-textPassage dm-l-articleGrid--main">
            
                <p><span class="dm-dp-openingLines">From 2012&ndash;2019</span>, I ran a 9-month apprenticeship for people new to design and development that wanted to make their way into the tech industry. I&rsquo;ve previously written about <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/"><em>why</em> apprenticeships are valuable</a>; here are the details about <em>how</em> I ran them.</p>

                <div class="dm-c-carbonWrap">
                    <script async type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?zoneid=1696&amp;serve=CVYD42T&amp;placement=danielmallcom" id="_carbonads_js"></script>
                </div><!-- .dm-c-carbonWrap -->

                <p>Within that 7-year span, I had almost 20 apprentices. Some finished the apprenticeship; some didn&rsquo;t. Some got full-time jobs in the discipline they pursued during their apprenticeship. Some took the skills they learned in their apprenticeship and applied them to a tangential industry. Some went freelance or started their own companies. Some went back to doing what they did before the apprenticeship.</p>

                <p>As I write this information for the first time, I&rsquo;m realizing in hindsight how valuable documenting this earlier would have been for me and even moreso for my apprentices. I&rsquo;m partially writing all of this down as a resource for myself in case I ever bring the apprenticeship back again.</p>
                
                <p lang="fr">C&lsquo;est la vie.</p> 

                <h2 id="objective">Objective <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#objective">#</a></h2>
                
                <p>To unlock a new way of life for the apprentice through gaining knowledge of web design and/or web development and the accompanying industry.</p>


                <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#prerequisites">#</a></h2>

                <p>Computer proficiency. As little prior knowledge about design and development is preferred, as most of it would likely have to be untaught. If you can already make a design or development portfolio, you&rsquo;re over-qualified for this apprenticeship.</p>                


                <h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#required-materials">#</a></h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Laptop</li>
                </ul>


                <h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#attendance-policy">#</a></h2>

                <p>At the beginning of the apprenticeship, in-person attendance at SuperFriendly <abbr title="Headquarters">HQ</abbr> 4&ndash;5 days a week from 10<abbr title="Ante meridien">am</abbr>&ndash;4<abbr title="Post meridien">pm</abbr> is required. During the second and third units of the apprenticeship, in-person attendance can decrease and independent remote work can increase.</p>

                <p>(Because so much of the learning was designed to be passive, I could never figure out how to make a remote apprenticeship work as well as an in-person one, so to date it has never been an option that I offered.)</p>

                <h1>Questions to answer</h1>     

                <ul>
                    <li>When you put an apprentice on a project, whatâ€™s the balance of time between them watching you work and asking questions, vs. them working on their own and asking you questions on an as-needed basis?</li>
                    <li>Do you happen to have any apprentice exit interview questions/topics you used for your apprentices? Quincy's last day is Monday and while I have some things I'd like to talk about, I wanted to see if you had topics you like to get into.</li>
