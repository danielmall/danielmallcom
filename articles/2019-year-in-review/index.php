                <p>I&rsquo;ll start by assessing how I did against the things I forecasted from last year.</p>

                <h2 id="eleven">Eleven <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#eleven">#</a></h2>

                <p role="text">Em and I celebrated our 11th anniversary in 2019! We were going to throw a big bash called the <span aria-hidden="true">Ma11 Ba11</span><span class="dm-u-move--offscreen"> Mall Ball</span>&mdash;get it?&mdash;but then we realized that it would really stress out these two introverts to plan and throw a giant party and that we&rsquo;d much rather travel together. So we spent a long weekend in Cuba instead!</p>

                <p>Sidda and Charlie are now 8 years old and 6 years old respectively. They&rsquo;re getting to those ages where there&rsquo;s lots to share about them, but I&rsquo;m also increasingly more inclined to keep their personal details private. Suffice it to say that the older they get, the more I&rsquo;m enjoying being their dad.</p>

                <h2 id="health-wellness-self-care">Health, wellness, and self-care <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#health-wellness-self-care">#</a></h2>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been drinking a lot more water this year, thanks to always having my <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/21-oz-standard-mouth-flex/color,lava,a,92,o,54">HydroFlask</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2tjcV8p">Coca-Cola tumblers</a> filled with ice water nearby. I thought this would help me drink less soda, but alas, I&rsquo;m still as addicted to cola as ever. (IT&rsquo;S SO DELICIOUS.)</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that I&rsquo;m still playing basketball regularly, an average of once every two weeks. An ankle sprain about 2 months ago has put me out of commission recently, but I&rsquo;m <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1211726228979355648">slowly getting back into atheltic activity again</a>.</p>

                <p>One thing I&rsquo;m really happy about is that I&rsquo;m eating at home more now. I really enjoy cooking, but very rarely do I block out the time to do it. So, I end up defaulting to fast food a lot. Over the last 6 months, however, subscriptions to meal services <a href="https://my.tovala.com/referral/JPP5WDZR">Tovala</a> and <a href="https://eat.cookunity.com/landing-referral?referral_code=danmal96/">CookUnity</a> have got me eating quick and delicious meals, and I&rsquo;m also saving a little money every month too.</p>

                <p><a href="/articles/my-experience-with-laser-eye-surgery/">I finally got laser eye surgery</a> this year. <abbr title="Too long; didn&rsquo;t read">TL;DR</abbr>: if you can deal with a first few hours of inconvenience, it&rsquo;s awesome. Almost one year later, I&rsquo;m really loving the little things, like forgetting to bring contact solution on a trip or worrying about a contact lens getting bumped out while playing sports.</p>

                <p>I wanted to get my second tattoo this year, but it didn&rsquo;t happen. But! It&rsquo;s definitely happening in 2020. I have the appointment already booked, and bonus: my brother and I are gonna get the same one together.</p>

                <p>I started therapy again this year after about a year-long break. It&rsquo;s been helpful at times, but I think I need to be clearer with myself (and my therapist) about what I want out of it.</p>

                <p>That&rsquo;s almost triple the amount from last year. I&rsquo;m not sure if that matters, though it might be a sign that I&rsquo;ve actually given myself some extra space that I was looking for last year to grow and learn.</p>

                <p>I also gave myself a lot more permission to not finish books this year. I think this comes from a combination of 2 things:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>In <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2016/08/i-buy-more-books-than-i-read/">I Buy More Books Than I Read</a>, Shawn Blanc says, &ldquo;All I care about is getting one good idea or story from that book. If I get that, then it&rsquo;s worth it to me&hellip; A life- and business-changing idea for $10 or less? Sold.&rdquo;</li>
                    <li>Audible has <a href="https://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4592/~/can-i-return%2Fexchange-my-book%3F">a very generous return policy</a>: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unhappy with your book, you can return or exchange it easily as long as it&rsquo;s within 365 days of the original purchase. Our exchange policy is risk-free. It allows active members to take a chance on a new narrator or story without losing a credit. Our ability to continue to offer this benefit is dependent on our members using it for this purpose only.&rdquo; Because of this generosity, I return audiobooks liberally while being conscious about whether or not I&rsquo;m abusing this policy, but I also purchase audiobooks liberally too. This kind of policy feels like it&rsquo;s coming from a company that respects its customers, and I&rsquo;m happy to reward that kind of company with my business.</li>
                </ol>


                <h2 id="travel">Travel <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink" href="#travel">#</a></h2>

                <p>This year, for both work and personal reasons, I got to visit:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Chicago, <abbr title="Illinois">IL</abbr></li>
                    <li>Austin, <abbr title="Texas">TX</abbr></li>

                    <li>Orlando, <abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr></li>
                </ol>

                <p>All of my international trips this year were the first times in each of those locations. I had already previously been to every <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> city I visited this year. There are a lot of places in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> I haven&rsquo;t been, and I feel myself getting the itch for an road trip around the country. Perhaps that&rsquo;s in the cards for the next few years.</p>
                

                <h2>Taking care of my body</h2>

                <p>I did some better things for my mind and body this past year. </p>

                <p>I love soda and I really don&rsquo;t like drinking water. That&rsquo;s not a great combo, so I changed some of that around in 2018. First, I realized that I much prefer cold water to room temp, so I got a <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/21-oz-standard-mouth-flex/color,lava,a,92,o,54">HydroFlask bottle</a> that&rsquo;s always filled with ice water. I also realized that some flavor in my water goes a long way, so my bottle is always filled with lemon, lime, oranges, strawberries, mint, cantaloupe, watermelon, or some combination of those. Those factors increased my water intake from virtually none to some. I also think that means that I drink soda less, but that might just be an unsubstantiated feeling. I quit soda in 2013 for about a year but am back on the sauce; perhaps 2019 is the year I quit again, or at least reduce my soda intake some.</p>

                <p>I played basketball just about every Monday night. It&rsquo;s a competitively friendly full court run for 2 hours. Looking forward to continuing that again in 2019.</p>

                <p>I also made more of a concerted effort to lift or do some form of calisthenics a few times a week. I&rsquo;m less regular during busy work weeks, but I was going at least once or twice a week for a good stretch. Rather than do an intense program, <a href="https://twitter.com/octaviusanewman">Octavius Newman</a> turned me on to Jim Wendler&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lift.net/workout-routines/wendler-5-3-1/">5/3/1 workout</a>, which is more about a slow and methodical way to build strength over a long term. This is much more my speed and pace, as I tend to get discouraged over workout programs if I lose my regularity about them.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m getting tired of contacts every day like I&rsquo;ve had for the last 20 years, so I&rsquo;d like to investigate laser eye surgery for 2019.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve also had the idea for a few years to get the same or similar tattoo as my <a href="http://v2.danielmall.com/archives/2006/06/26/grandpa.php">grandfather</a> had from his time in the Filipino navy. After a conversation about tattoos with <a href="https://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> earlier this year, I think 2019 is the year that I make this happen.</p>

                <h2>Good for the sole</h2>

                <p>I really indulged my sneaker fetish this year. </p>

                <p>I added these to my collection: Jordan 1 Mid University Gold; Jordan 1 Retro High OG Top 3; Air Max 97 JDI; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Racer Pink; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Dynamic Yellow; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Cool Grey; Jordan 1 &ldquo;Homage to Home&rdquo;; Jordan 1 Mid Royal Splatter; Puma Roma; Nike Air Safari OG 2018; Jordan 1 Black/White RE2PECT; Nike SF Air Force 1; Jordan 1 Ret Hi NYC; and Air Jordan 1 Retro High.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve got a side project or two that I'd like to do around my sneaker collection. Maybe 2019 will be the year. Probably not though. </p>

                <h2>Travel</h2>

                <p>As one who didn&rsquo;t travel much as a kid, I feel very fortunate every year I get to visit other places in the world. In 2018, I took both work and non-work trips to Cambridge, MA; Chicago, IL; Greensboro, NC; Salt Lake City, UT;  Las Vegas, NV; Faroe Islands; New York, NY; Seattle, WA; Toronto, Ontario; Marin County, CA; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Strathmere, NJ; Mayfield, OH; Brooklyn, NY; Paris, France; Zurich, Switzerland; Orlando, FL; and Houston, TX. </p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to visiting more amazing places in 2019.  So far, I&rsquo;ve got trips lined up to Chicago, IL; Austin, TX; Seattle, WA; Boston, MA; and Toronto, Ontario, and likely adding Scotland, Los Angeles, New Zealand, Japan, and China to the list.</p>

                <h2>Conferences, workshops, and training</h2>

                <p>In 2018, I spoke at 11 conferences, both virtually and in-person: <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/design-systems-virtual-summit-2018">UXPin Design Systems Virtual Summit 2018</a>; LoopConf; <a href="https://aycl.uie.com/virtual_seminars/which_new_skills_should_designers_pursue">UIE All You Can Learn Library</a>; Generate Conference NYC; Smashing Conference in <a href="https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2018/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/ny-2018/">New York City</a>; An Event Apart in <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2018"> Washington DC</a> and <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/orlando-2018">Orlando</a>; <a href="https://frontendconf.ch/">Frontend Conference</a>; <a href="https://conference.awwwards.com/new-york/">Awwwards Digital Thinkers Conference</a>; and <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/2018">Clarity Conference</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2019, I&rsquo;ll be speaking at <a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/event/owner-summit-2019">Owner Summit</a>; An Event Apart in <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/seattle-2019">Seattle</a> and <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/boston-2019">Boston</a>; and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/">Smashing Conference Toronto</a>. I&rsquo;ll be adding to that list as the year progresses, so watch this space.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m excited to add more training to my repertoire in 2019. <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> and I are excited to help designers an developers collaborate better, starting with a <a href="https://designdevjan2019.splashthat.com/">workshop in Philly</a>! We'll be doing a few more of these public workshops throughout the year; more details on that soon. If you&rsquo;re interested in us doing a private workshop for your organization, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a> and let&rsquo;s talk.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m also putting some plans together for some specialized training. I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of resources to help mid-level designers at startups and agencies get over the hump to being art directors and design directors, so I&rsquo;m developing a curriculum specifically for this. It&rsquo;ll likely be about a week-long, intensive workshop. It won&rsquo;t be cheap, but we&rsquo;ll work hard, eat well, and build a strong support network. More on that soon.</p>

                <p>Video will be a format I lean into much more for 2019. I'm so inspired by watching my friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curlswithcoral/">Coral Rosado</a> and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/joshluciano?uid=ub6zWFUf0P9Kp8AI6k797A">Josh Luciano</a> grow their skills and audience on their Instagram and YouTube channels, and I already got a decent taste with the <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager/expert-advice">Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale</a> series <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a>,  <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>, and I produced with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, as well as <a href="http://skl.sh/superfriendly">my Skillshare class on Design Systems</a>. I&rsquo;ve officially caught the video bug.</p>

                <h2>Concerts</h2>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been a musician since I was 3, but I haven&rsquo;t historically gone to many concerts. In 2018, Em and I changed that by going to see Lauryn Hill, Jennifer Lopez, Kendrick Lamar, Kenny Chesney, Beyonc&eacute; &amp; Jay-Z. We were also going to see Justin Timberlake, but <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/justin-timberlake-tour-cancelation-coachella/">he bruised his vocal chords</a>. Feel better soon, JT.</p>

                <h2>Books</h2>

                <p>I did a decent amount of reading in 2018. I read or started to read <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2BVdMgt">Getting to Yes</a></cite> by Roger Fisher; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnlWai">Principles: Life and Work</a></cite> by Ray Dalio; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ru8X7x">Batman: Nightwalker</a></cite> by Marie Lu; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SyPIXC">The Art of Screen Time</a></cite> by Anya Kamenetz; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SyPIXC">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</a></cite> by Ramit Sethi; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SseY1M">It Doesn&rsquo;t Have to be Crazy at Work</a></cite> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson; <cite>Batman Vol 1–7</cite> by Tom King; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SwMJ29">Artemis</a></cite> by Andy Weir; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SCV98h">The Snowball System</a> by Mo Bunnell; <a href="https://amzn.to/2CM4qoP">The Spaceship Next Door</a></cite> by Gene Doucett; and <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Sy3bPs">To Sell is Human</a></cite> by Daniel H. Pink. That feels pretty inadequate compared to Em&rsquo;s goal of 100 books every year, but I&rsquo;ll settle for about one per month.</p>

                <h2>Miscellany</h2>
                <ul><li>We got 2 orange tabby kittens: Nala and Simba. They&rsquo;re annoying, but  the kids love them.
                </li><li>We&rsquo;ve been inviting friends over semi-regularly for board games and/or karaoke. They&rsquo;re a ton of fun and laughs; more of this in 2019.
                </li><li>I attended more funerals and viewings than I cared to this year (or ever), including one for my uncle who was the patriarch of our large extended family, as well as for my former college roommate who passed away from Hodgkin's lymphoma. Fuck cancer.

                <h2>Clearing my plate for 2019</h2>

                <p>Work-wise, I&rsquo;d like to change things a bit in 2019. I&rsquo;ve spent the last few years learning and practicing how to direct projects. That means largely being in charge of the vision for what SuperFriendly teams would make, and how. That also means that while I was involved in many projects, I was rarely directly responsible for the main output myself. </p>

                <p>For 2019 projects, I&rsquo;m going to try to be responsible for more output myself. That means I&rsquo;ll be working in design tools and code a lot more. I know I typically tend to be in this mode all by myself, so I&rsquo;m going to challenge myself to continue to work with the same amount of people, but more as a collaborator than a director.</p>

                <p>To do this, I know I&rsquo;ll need more familiarity with tools and technologies. I spent some time during the holidays learning the fundamentals of both Rails and Laravel and building a few &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; examples. I&rsquo;m beefing up my React chops in preparation for a few upcoming projects. I have a post drafted about design tooling. I&rsquo;m learning Swift so I can design and build an iPhone app end-to-end myself.</p>

                <p>That&rsquo;s a lot. In order to do all of that, I have to clear my plate a bit of things that I think I&rsquo;m done with, either for now or forever. </p>

                <p>For the last 6 months or so, I&rsquo;ve had the feeling that certain chapters of my life are closing, while others are opening. But I&rsquo;m not sure which ones are which. So, I&rsquo;ve been taking inventory of all the things in my life, both personally and professionally, to see what things have run their course. This has included everything from taking a sabbatical to moving to a different state to shutting down SuperFriendly and taking a full-time job somewhere to being a full-time stay-at-home dad, and everything in-between. I&rsquo;m not quite ready to share any conclusions from this meditation&mdash;not even sure I have any quite yet&mdash;but there are a few things that are a bit clearer than others.</p>

                <ul><li>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/articles/passing-the-superbooked-baton/">passed the baton for SuperBooked</a> to my partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/philipzaengle">Phil Zaengle</a>.  I&rsquo;ll still be involved with this product that I love, but in more less frequent capacity.
                </li><li>Unintentionally, I opened a small <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">design and development apprenticeship</a> in 2012. After almost 7 years, I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;ve had almost 20 apprentices. That&rsquo;s a lot! I think I&rsquo;ve given all I have to offer here; I no longer have the desire to scratch this particular itch. So, as of 2019, I&rsquo;m closing the apprenticeship. 
                </li></ul>

                <p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the opportunities this new year can bring that I have some space for. Bring it on, 2019!</p>
